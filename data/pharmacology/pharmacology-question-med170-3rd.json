    "options": [
      "Levodopa does not slow the progress of Parkinson's disease",
      "Selegiline is a selective MAO-A inhibitor used for Parkinson's disease",

      "Carbidopa is an effective dopamine decarboxylase inhibitor in the CNS"
    ],
    "answer": ["Levodopa does not slow the progress of Parkinson's disease"],
    "explanation": "Levodopa can help manage the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, such as tremors and stiffness, but it does not slow the progression of the disease itself. Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, and while levodopa can improve quality of life, it does not alter the underlying disease process."
