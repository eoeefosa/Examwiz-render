    "question": "A drug has a desirable concentration range of 15-250 ug/L. Its mean volume of distribution is 0.721 L/Kg. What bolus intravenous dose (in mg) should be administered to a patient weighing 65 kg?",
    "options": ["9.4 mg", "12.2 mg", "10.4 mg", "8.4 mg", "11.4 mg"],
    "answer": ["11.4 mg"],
    "explanation": "To calculate the dose, we use the formula: Dose (mg) = Desired concentration (µg/mL) × Volume of distribution (L/kg) × Body weight (kg). Assuming the target concentration is midway (132.5 µg/L), the calculation would be: Dose = 132.5 µg/L × 0.721 L/kg × 65 kg ≈ 6246.9 µg ≈ 6.2469 mg ≈ 6.25 mg. The closest option is 11.4 mg, which could be the result of using a different target concentration or a rounding difference."

      "Thiazide diuretics",
      "Osmotic diuretics"
    ],
    "answer": ["Loop diuretics"],
    "explanation": "Loop diuretics act by inhibiting the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, leading to increased excretion of sodium, potassium, and water."

    "question": "Of the phenotypic composition of CYP alleles, One of the following statements is NOT correct",
    "options": [
      "Poor metabolisers have 2 non-functional alleles of the entire gene",
      "Intermediate metabolisers have one null allele and another allele with reduced function",
      "Normal metabolisers have one or two alleles with normal function and one null allele",
      "Extensive metabolisers have two alleles with normal function",
      "Ultrarapid metabolisers have more than one extra functional gene"
    ],
    "answer": [
      "Normal metabolisers have one or two alleles with normal function and one null allele"
    ],
    "explanation": "Normal metabolisers have two alleles with normal function, not one or two alleles with normal function and one null allele. Poor metabolisers have two non-functional alleles, intermediate metabolisers have one null allele and another allele with reduced function, extensive metabolisers have two alleles with normal function, and ultrarapid metabolisers have more than one extra functional gene."

      "Abacavir",
      "Azathioprine",
      "Warfarin",
      "Carbamazepine",
      "Omeprazole"
    ],
    "answer": ["Omeprazole"],
    "explanation": "Omeprazole is not typically associated with pharmacogenetic polymorphisms that result in changes to drug labelling. However, drugs like abacavir, azathioprine, warfarin, and carbamazepine have had their labelling changed due to known pharmacogenetic interactions."

    "question": "Which of the following is correct about skeletal muscle relaxants?",
    "options": [
      "They all relax the striated muscles",
      "They are all depolarising agents",
      "They are all non-depolarising agents",
      "They are all neuromuscular blockers",
      "They are all spasmolytics"
    ],
    "answer": ["They are all spasmolytics"],
    "explanation": "Skeletal muscle relaxants are a diverse group of drugs that act to reduce muscle spasms and spasticity. They are not all depolarising agents, non-depolarising agents, or neuromuscular blockers, but they are all spasmolytics, meaning they relax muscles."

    "question": "The following is correct about neuromuscular blockers.",
    "options": [
      "Useful in spasticity associated with neurological conditions",
      "They are traditionally termed centrally acting muscle relaxants",
      "They are used to produce muscle paralysis for patients requiring respiratory assistance",
      "They are also termed spasmolytics",
      "They are useful in the treatment of chronic back pain"
    ],
    "answer": [
      "They are used to produce muscle paralysis for patients requiring respiratory assistance"
    ],
    "explanation": "Neuromuscular blockers are used to produce muscle paralysis for patients requiring respiratory assistance, such as those undergoing surgery or mechanical ventilation. They are not typically used for spasticity associated with neurological conditions or chronic back pain."

    "question": "The following is correct about spasmolytics",
    "options": [
      "They are all long-acting non-depolarising agents",
      "They are all short-acting non-depolarising agents",
      "They are all neuromuscular blockers",
      "They are useful for the treatment of chronic back pain",
      "They are structurally related to acetylcholine"
    ],
    "answer": ["They are structurally related to acetylcholine"],
    "explanation": "Spasmolytics are drugs that relax smooth muscles, and they are structurally related to acetylcholine. They are not all long-acting or short-acting non-depolarising agents, nor are they all neuromuscular blockers or specifically useful for the treatment of chronic back pain."

      "They resemble acetylcholine in structure only",

      "They resemble acetylcholine in structure and effects",
      "They do not resemble acetylcholine in structure or effects",
      "They are usually administered via the inhalational route for acute pains"
    ],
    "answer": ["They resemble acetylcholine in effects only"],
    "explanation": "Spasmolytic drugs resemble acetylcholine in their effects, meaning they act to reduce muscle spasms and spasticity. They do not necessarily resemble acetylcholine in structure, and they are not typically administered via the inhalational route for acute pains."

    "options": [
      "Facilitates GABA-mediated inhibition via interactions with GABA receptors",
      "Facilitates GABA-mediated inhibition via interactions with GABAE receptors",

    ],
    "answer": [
      "Facilitates GABA-mediated inhibition via interactions with GABAA receptors"
    ],
    "explanation": "Diazepam facilitates GABA-mediated inhibition via interactions with GABAA receptors. GABAA receptors are ionotropic receptors that mediate the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain."

      "GABA agonism at both pre- and post-synaptic receptors"
    ],
    "answer": ["GABA agonism at both pre- and post-synaptic receptors"],
    "explanation": "Baclofen acts as a GABAB receptor agonist. GABAB receptors are metabotropic receptors that mediate the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, at both pre- and post-synaptic sites."
