    "explanation": "Ketoacidosis is not a characteristic of galactosemia, but rather a complication that can arise in patients with galactosemia under certain circumstances such as sepsis\n\n Toxic levels of galactose in blood results in  \na. hepatomegally,\nb. cirrhosis of the liver,\nc. renal failure,\nd. cataract,\ne. brain damage etc.\n\nGalactosemia is associated with:\n 1. lethargy\n 2. vomiting\n 3. diarrhoea\n 4. hypoglycemia\n 5. failure to thrive\n 6. jaundice from liver involvement\n 7. mental retardation\n 7. cataract( accumulation of galactitol deposit)\n\nClinitest is a test used to determine the amount of reducing substances, typically glucose, in urine. It provide clinically useful information on carbohydrate levels. Clinitest uses a chemical reaction involving cupric sulfate, sodium hydroxide, and citric acid. when glucose is added to the clinitest tablet in a test tube filled with uring, the glucose react with the chemicals in the tablet, forming a colored compound called cuprous oxide. The intensity of the color indicates the level of glucose in the urine \n\n clinistix tablets are used to test glucose level in urine. Positive clinistix results in patients with galactosemia are unlikely because galactosemia is characterized by excessive amount of galactose, not glucose. Therefore, a positive clinistix test would indicate the presence of glucoes, while galactosemia would suggest the opposite- high levels of galactose and hypoglycemia. If a pateint with galactosemia had a false-postive Clinistix result, it would be advisable to confirm the finding with a test specifically designed for glucose detection, such as clinistix or a blood glucose meter. The clinistix use a double sequential enzymatic reaction. Glucose oxidase converts glucoes into gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Then, peroxidase catalyzes the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, producing a colored product. The intensity of the color correlates with the level of glucosee in the urine",
