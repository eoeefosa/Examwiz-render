    "explanation": "High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is responsible for transporting cholesterol from extrahepatic tissues (tissues outside the liver) back to the liver, where it can be excreted or recycled. This process, known as reverse cholesterol transport, helps maintain cholesterol balance in the body and is thought to have a protective effect against heart disease."

    "question": "Activated lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase is essential for the conversion of:",
    "options": [
      "VLDL remnant into LDL",
      "Nascent HDL into HDL",
      "HDL-2 into HDL-3",
      "HDL-3 into HDL-2"
    ],
    "answer": ["Nascent HDL into HDL"],
    "explanation": "Lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) is an enzyme that plays a key role in the metabolism of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. It catalyzes the esterification of cholesterol, converting nascent HDL particles into mature HDL particles. This process is essential for the reverse cholesterol transport pathway, which helps remove excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues and transport it back to the liver for excretion."

    "question": "Which of the following is not a chronic complication of renal replacement therapy?",
    "options": [
      "Dialysis dysequilibrium syndrome.",
      "Anaemia.",
      "Peritonitis.",
      "Malnutrition."
    ],
    "answer": ["Dialysis dysequilibrium syndrome."],
    "explanation": "Peritonitis is an acute complication of peritoneal dialysis, a form of renal replacement therapy. It is characterized by inflammation of the peritoneum, the membrane that lines the abdominal cavity. While peritonitis is a serious complication that requires prompt treatment, it is not considered a chronic complication of renal replacement therapy."

    "question": "Biochemical features of Wilson's disease include:",
    "options": [
      "Increase in plasma ceruloplasmin.",
      "Low urinary excretion of copper.",
      "Normal total serum copper.",
      "Low plasma ceruloplasmin."
    ],
    "answer": ["Low plasma ceruloplasmin."],
    "explanation": "Wilson's disease is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal copper metabolism, leading to copper accumulation in various tissues, including the liver and brain. One of the biochemical features of Wilson's disease is a decrease in plasma ceruloplasmin, a protein that binds copper and transports it in the blood. This results in an increase in free copper levels in the blood, which can lead to copper toxicity."

    "question": "In which of the following regions of the gastrointestinal tract will the loss of fluid lead to metabolic acidosis and hypokalaemia?",
    "options": ["Small intestine", "Appendix", "Colon", "Gall bladder"],
    "answer": ["Small intestine"],
    "explanation": "The colon, also known as the large intestine, plays a crucial role in maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance in the body. Loss of fluid from the colon can lead to metabolic acidosis and hypokalemia, as the colon is responsible for reabsorbing water and electrolytes from the stool before it is excreted from the body. Conditions such as diarrhea can result in excessive fluid loss from the colon, leading to these electrolyte imbalances."

    "question": "Stimulation of hydrochloric acid secretion involves:",
    "options": ["Cholecystokinin", "Lipase", "Secretin", "Vagus nerve"],
    "answer": ["Vagus nerve"],
    "explanation": "The secretion of hydrochloric acid (HCl) in the stomach is primarily regulated by the vagus nerve, which stimulates the release of HCl from the parietal cells of the stomach lining. Cholecystokinin, secretin, and lipase are all involved in the digestive process, but they do not directly stimulate HCl secretion."

    "question": "All of the following statements are true concerning urobilinogen, except:",
    "options": [
      "Produced by oxidative action of intestinal bacteria.",
      "Undergoes significant enterohepatic circulation.",
      "Urinary levels are increased in biliary obstruction.",
      "Fecal levels are decreased in biliary obstruction"
    ],
    "answer": ["Urinary levels are increased in biliary obstruction."],
    "explanation": "Urobilinogen is a byproduct of the breakdown of bilirubin in the intestine by intestinal bacteria. It is reabsorbed into the bloodstream and taken up by the liver, where it is either re-excreted into bile or converted into urobilin and excreted in the feces. Urinary levels of urobilinogen are typically low, and they are not significantly affected by biliary obstruction."

    "question": "Gluconeogenesis occurs in the liver because of the presence of",
    "options": [
      "Phosphofructokinase",
      "Pyruvate carboxylase",
      "Glucose-6-phosphate",
      "Glucokinase"
    ],
    "answer": ["Glucose-6-phosphate"],
    "explanation": "Gluconeogenesis is the process by which glucose is synthesized from non-carbohydrate precursors, such as amino acids, lactate, and glycerol. This process primarily occurs in the liver and to a lesser extent in the kidneys. Pyruvate carboxylase is an enzyme that catalyzes a key step in gluconeogenesis, the carboxylation of pyruvate to form oxaloacetate, which can then be converted into glucose."

    "question": "Crigler-Najjar syndrome Type II occurs due to---",
    "options": [
      "Excess production of bilirubin",
      "Complete absence of the conjugating enzyme",
      "Partial deficiency of the conjugating enzyme",
      "Overexpression of the conjugating enzyme"
    ],
    "answer": ["Partial deficiency of the conjugating enzyme"],
    "explanation": "Crigler-Najjar syndrome Type II is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a partial deficiency of the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, which is responsible for conjugating bilirubin in the liver. This results in an accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood, leading to jaundice and potentially severe neurological complications. Crigler-Najjar syndrome Type II is less severe than Type I, which is caused by a complete absence of the enzyme."
