    "question": "which of the following enzymes is used for Pre-PCR decontamination procedures?",
    "options": [
      "DNA glycosylase",
      "DNA polymerase",
      "DNA Ligase",
      "Reverse transcriptase",
      "Elastase"
    ],
    "answer": ["DNA glycosylase"],
    "explanation": "DNA glycosylase is used in pre-PCR decontamination procedures to remove any DNA contamination that could interfere with the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) process. This enzyme can specifically recognize and remove damaged or incorrect bases in DNA."

      "Detect infectious diseases",
      "Monitor hormone levels",
      "Monitor clotting profile"
    ],
    "answer": ["Detect infectious diseases"],
    "explanation": "Molecular diagnostic tests, such as PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and nucleic acid amplification tests, can be used to detect infectious diseases by identifying the genetic material (DNA or RNA) of pathogens like viruses and bacteria in patient samples."

      "Hereditary Coproporphyria",
      "None of the above"
    ],
    "answer": ["None of the above"],
    "explanation": "Acute porphyrias are a group of rare metabolic disorders characterized by abnormalities in heme production. Erythropoietic porphyria, variegate porphyria, acute intermittent porphyria, and hereditary coproporphyria are all examples of acute porphyrias."

      "Luteinizing hormone",
      "Follicle stimulating hormone",
      "Inhibin"
    ],
    "answer": ["Oestrogen"],
    "explanation": "Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) is a hormone produced by the placenta during pregnancy. HCG levels increase rapidly in the early stages of pregnancy and remain elevated throughout pregnancy. It is the hormone detected by pregnancy tests."

    ],
    "answer": ["Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion"],
    "explanation": "Hypersecretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), also known as vasopressin, can lead to a condition known as syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH). SIADH is characterized by excessive water retention and hyponatremia."

    ],
    "answer": ["Assessing the Ovarian reserve"],
    "explanation": "Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is a hormone produced by cells in the ovarian follicles. It is used as a marker of ovarian reserve, which refers to the number and quality of a woman's eggs. AMH levels can help assess the likelihood of success with fertility treatments."
