Excess copper can lead to 
hemolysis
and hypotension

Wilson disease
Some amount of plasma copper is losely bound to albumin but most of copper is incopperated into the protein celuloplasmin and copper is mainly
excreted in bile
 There are 2 main defect of copper metabolism in wilson disease
 1. impaired bilairy excretion of copper leading to deposition of copper in the liver
 2. There is deficiency of celuloplasmin resulting in low plasma concentration
 most of the copper is in lossly bound form and its is therefore deposited in the tissue
 more than normal amount of copper is filtered at the level of the glomerulus and as a result urinary copper is increased
 Excessive depostion of copper in the eyes, basal ganglia of the  brain, the liver and renal tubules produces kaysty's fleischer  at the
 edges of the corner due to deposition of copper in the decement membrane

 Nerological symptoms can be seen due to degradtioon of basal ganglian leading to cirosis

 renal tubular damage with any or all of the biochemical features including amyloaciduria

 diagnosis

1. a demostration of low plasma celuloplamsin 0.2g/l
a. demostration of low plasma copper < 0.12
high urinary copper excression >0.1mol per day

2. penciallemine test: it is sometimes use in the diagnosis of wilson dx. it solubulises copper and enhances copper excretion. 
After oral dose of penciallamine urinary copper excretion is >25mmol/day 

low plasma celuloplamsin are sometimes occur due to malnutrintion and neprotic syndrome
the mode of inheritance is recessive

the treatment with copper celating agent such as D-penciallamine and it may reduce copper concentration

## Selenium

The main function of Selenium is to mediated the activity of the enzyme Glutatione oxidace with act as antioxidate
deficiency can be caused by poor intake(seen in china)

deficiency can cause cadiamyopathy (rashan dx)
ostoatrapathy (kaschin beck)

myopathy 
microcytosis 
anemia


diagnosis is by measurement of blood Selenium 


## Maganese
This is an enzyme co- factor e.g 
superoxide desudated
deficiency is associated with vit k deficiency and may be seen in patient who are been feed artifically
Maganese excess can occur in miner of Maganese ore and can result in pakinson like disease 


Cromium
it is an insulin cofactor
It can occur in long term parental nutrition leading to glucose intolerance and neropathy
Toxicity is associated with Git problems lung cancer and hepatatis

Mylobedenum
cofactor of Xythine oxidase and other enzyme can occur on long term parental nutrition and may lead to parengeal or central
scrotones, night blindness and comma. 

Cobolt
It is important for vit B12 metabolism
Toxicity is rare but sometimes seen in dialysis patient and heavy drinker of beer contaminated with Cobolt
with can lead to cardiomyopathy



Vitamin
Essenctial nutriteint that cannot be synthesis deno vo and must be obtain from diet or intestinal flora

required in small ammout relative to macro nutriteint such as fat protein and carbohydrate

classification
a. according to water solubulity 
1. water soluble 
folic acid 
cobalmin


2. fat soluble
ADEK

Vitamin play biological roles in the body
1. as cofactor for enzyme 
2. signaling molecule
2. antioxidate defence (E)
4. structural component of protein(A)

thiamin
It need to be converted to thiamin pyrophosphate
coenzyme for carb utilization
a. pyruvate to Acyty CoA 
b. convertion of 2 five carbon sugar to ribose 5 phospate and xylose 5 phostphate to psuedohetulose active in RBC and catalised by trans ketolase with need thamine and growthfactor
 A low RBC transketolase is a relable indicator of Thiamine deficiency

Thamine deficency occurs in 
1. Alcohol intake
2. REfedding after stavation
3. parental nutrition
4. renal Dialysis
5. population where diet consist predominatly of polished rice


Clinial s
beribery

may manifest as 
1. wet beribery or Cvs 
There is cardiac failure 
peripheral vasodialation
patient may present acutely with shock and severe lactic acidosis
it is called socine berybery

2. Dry berybery The symptomsis 
peripheral neuropathy
wilincase enchalophathy
othamophagial
nistqagmy

3. osacuf sycyosis
severe deficit of short term memory

## Riboflavin
precausor of flavin nucleotide e.g flavin 
with transfer electrons in many catalyse nuclotide reaction
1. mitochrondial electron transport
2. beTA osudate of flavin faty acid
3. glutation reductate

RBC glothation reductace activity is used as dianosis test for riboflavin deficincy
they are bight yellow.  they are sensivitive to light 
why mutivitamin are kept in dark containers? 

hyper biliubic baby can have B2 deficeny when exposed to light
