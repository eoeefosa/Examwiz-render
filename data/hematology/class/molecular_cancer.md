Heterogenous diverse group of disease that affect 3 systems

corruption of any of those stages as a result of corruption of in hematologyica process

Most malignacies develop from mutations

baSIC CONCPTS OF HEMATOLOGYICAL MALIGNANCIES

1. Most malignancise are thought to result from servearl mutations, acquired sequentially and randomly
   Eidence demostrate that more than one mutation is necssary for full malignacies

classification

1. Myeloid malignancies
1. CharacteriesticL feature of HMs is capacity to sell renwen itsellf. This sugest that tumour result from transformation of a sell
   orignial mutation may occur in a matured cell destined to differetiate to die eg
1. Lymphoid malignancies

cLASSIFICAATION
classified base on diagnosis and treament you would give
genetic morphology
how long it takes for the malignacy to occur

Classifications

3. Plasma cell desplacisia
4. Myoldisplastic syndrom
5. myelproliferative neoplasm

Most of them are form the lymphoid origin

q. Most of the hematologica malignalies are from the myeloid series Fasle'

Blood cancer forms 6% of all the cancers in the world
NHl is the most common 61%

VARIOUS DEFINITIONS
Oncogen is a gene which has the potential to form cancer or transform a cell into a tumour cell

Protooncogens: nucleophophin
 Just before it becomes a full malignacy it depends on what you inherited from your parents

Over expression of mutant genes
2. Aviation of appotosis
3. Limitless replication potential 
4. insensitiivty to growth signal s

TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENE : 
cause loss of function
It reduces the activity of normal genes by preventing its production, dismutation cause


 Gain of function
It confers a new function to the cell
component of control mechanism that controll entry into the cell
