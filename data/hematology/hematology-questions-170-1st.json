    ],
    "explanation": "Hemolytic anemia is when red blood cells are destroyed faster than they are made. This causes low oxygen in the blood and jaundice, which is yellow skin and eyes. Jaundice is due to high unconjugated bilirubin, which is a pigment from red blood cell breakdown. The liver cannot clear all the bilirubin, so it builds up in the blood. Other signs of hemolytic anemia are low hemoglobin, high reticulocytes, high LDH, low haptoglobin, and abnormal red blood cells on blood smear. Coombs test can show if antibodies are causing hemolysis.",

This can result in hemoglobinuria, which is the presence of hemoglobin in the urine\n\nIron deficiency anemia is caused by low iron levels in the body, which affects the production of hemoglobin and red blood cells. It is usually due to blood loss or poor absorption of iron\n\nHaemolytic Uremic Syndrome is a rare disorder that causes hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), and kidney failure. It is usually triggered by an infection with a specific strain of Escherichia coli bacteria that produces toxins that damage the blood vessels and red blood cells. It is a type of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, which means that red blood cells are destroyed by abnormal blood vessels or clots.\n\nMegaloblastic anemia is caused by low levels of vitamin B12 or folate in the body, which affects the synthesis of DNA and the maturation of red blood cells. It is usually due to poor dietary intake or malabsorption of these vitamins\n\nAplastic anemia is caused by a failure of the bone marrow to produce enough blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). It is usually due to damage or destruction of the blood-forming stem cells by factors such as viral infections, radiation, toxic chemicals, or drugs\n\n.

    "explanation": "Hereditary spherocytosis is characterized by abnormalities in red blood cell membrane proteins, particularly spectrin, ankyrin, and band 3 protein. These abnormalities result in a loss of membrane stability and cause the red blood cells to assume a spherical shape. This altered shape makes them more prone to hemolysis, leading to anemia and other associated features of the condition.",
