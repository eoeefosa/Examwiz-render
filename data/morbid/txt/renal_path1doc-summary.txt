Introduction to Renal Function:

Kidneys convert over 1700L of blood to 1L of concentrated urine daily.
Main functions: excreting urea, regulating salt and water, maintaining acid/base balance, serving as an endocrine gland.
Clinical Manifestations of Renal Disease:

Azotemia: ↑↑BUN and Creatinine, associated with signs and symptoms leads to uremia.
Nephritic Syndrome: hematuria, proteinuria, hypertension.
Rapidly Progressive GN(Glomerulonephritis): characterized by a rapid course.
Nephrotic Syndrome: heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, severe edema, hyperlipidemia.
Asymptomatic hematuria or proteinuria: reflects mild glomerular abnormalities.
ARF (acute renal failure): dominated by oliguria or anuria and recent onset azotemia.
CRF (chronic renal failure): prolonged signs & symptoms of uremia, end result of CKD.
Renal Tubular Disease: polyuria, nocturia, electrolyte disorders.
UTI (urinary tract infection): bacteriuria, pyuria; pyelonephritis, cystitis.
Nephrolithiasis: renal stones causing renal colic with severe spasms of pain.
Urinary Tract Obstruction: due to renal/extrarenal tumors, obstructive uropathy.
Course/Progression of Renal Disease:

ARF: rapid onset, frequently reversible.
Diminished Renal Reserve: GFR is about 50% of normal, usually asymptomatic.
Renal Insufficiency: GFR is about 20-50% of normal.
CRF: GFR < 20-50%, edema, metabolic acidosis with overt uremia.
ESRD (End-stage renal disease): GFR < 5%, requires renal replacement therapy (dialysis, transplant).
Glomerular Diseases (GD):

GDs are major problems in nephrology and common causes of CKD.
Primary Glomerulopathies: Acute proliferative GN(Glomerulonephritis), Rapid Progressive GN, Membranous Glomerulopathy, Minimal Change Disease, Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis, Membranoproliferative GN(Glomerulonephritis), IgA Nephropathy, Chronic GN(Glomerulonephritis).
Systemic Diseases with Glomerular Involvement: SLE, DM, Amyloidosis, Goodpasture syndrome, etc.
Hereditary Disorders: Alport syndrome, Thin basement membrane disease, Fabry's disease.

Nephrotic Syndrome: >3.5g/day proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, increased lipidemia, lipiduria, anasarca.
CRF: azotemia leading to uremia, takes years to evolve.
Isolated Urinary Abnormalities: glomerular hematuria and/or subnephrotic proteinuria.
Glomerular Structure:

Glomerulus composed of capillaries, mesangium, and Bowman's capsule.
GBM( Glomerular Basement Membrane) has collagen, laminin, proteoglycans, fibronectin, entactin.
Slit diaphragm composed of Nephrin, Podocin, CD2-associated protein, and actin filaments.
Mutation in these genes can lead to Nephrotic Syndrome.
Histological Alterations:

Pathogenesis of Glomerular Injury:

Immune Mechanisms of Glomerular Injury:
a. Antibody-Mediated Injury:

In Situ Immune Complex Deposition:
Fixed intrinsic tissue Antigens: NCI(Non-Collagenous Interrupting) domain of COL IV(Collagen Type IV) antigen, Heymann antigen, Mesangial antigens, Planted antigens.
Exogenous (infectious agent, drugs) and Endogenous (DNA, Nuclear proteins, Ig, immune complexes IgA).
Circulating Immune Complex Deposition:
Endogenous antigens (DNA, Tumour antigens) and Exogenous antigens (infectious products).
b. Cell-Mediated Immune Injury
c. Activation of Alternative Complement Pathway

Specific Immune Mechanisms:

Heymann Nephritis:

GN(Glomerulonephritis) induced in rats by injecting antigens from the PT( Proximal Tubule) brush border.
Antibodies react with PT( Proximal Tubule) brush border and cross-react with an antigen on the basal surface of visceral epithelial cells.
Heymann antigen is a 330-KD protein called megalin.
MGNMGN( Membranous Glomerulonephritis) and anti-GBM-GN are autoimmune diseases caused by antibodies to endogenous tissue components.
Antibodies Against Planted Antigens:

GN(Glomerulonephritis) results from antibodies reacting against planted antigens not normally present in the glomerulus.
Antibodies react against cationic molecules complexed with anionic components (DNA, nuclear proteins, nucleosomes).
Anti-GBM Antibody-Induced GN:

Antibodies directed against intrinsic fixed antigens that are normal components of GBM( Glomerular Basement Membrane).
Experimental counterpart in rats: Masugi or Nephrotoxic Nephritis.
Cross-reactivity with other BM can lead to Goodpasture syndrome in humans.
Circulating Immune Complex GN(Glomerulonephritis):

Circulating immune complexes trapped within glomeruli.
Triggering antigens: endogenous (SLE) or exogenous (microbial products, bacterial/viral products, tumour antigens).
Chronic renal disease occurs if antigens are continuously shed.
Cytotoxic Antibodies to Glomerular Cells:

Antibodies reacting with cellular components cause cytotoxic injury.
Cell-Mediated Immune Injury in GN(Glomerulonephritis):

Activated T-cells implicated in glomerular injury and progression of GN(Glomerulonephritis).
Activated macrophages and T-cells found in glomeruli in some human and experimental GN(Glomerulonephritis).
Activation of Alternative Complement Pathway:

Found mainly in Dense Deposit Disease (MPGN(Membranoproliferative Glomerulonephritis) type II).
Occurs in other forms of proliferative GN(Glomerulonephritis).
Mediators of Glomerular Injury:

Neutrophils and Monocytes:

Attracted to glomeruli by C5a and Fc-mediated adherence.
Degranulation causes GBM( Glomerular Basement Membrane) degradation, cell damage, and hemodynamic changes.
Macrophages, T-lymphocytes & NK cells:

Infiltrate glomeruli following antibody and cell-mediated reactions.
Cause glomerular damage.
Platelet Aggregate:

Release eicosanoids and growth factors contributing to GN(Glomerulonephritis).
Antiplatelet agents are beneficial.
Resident Glomerular Cells (Mesangial cells):

When stimulated and activated, release pro-inflammatory mediators.
Soluble Mediators:

Chemotactic Complement Components:
C5a induces leukocyte influx.
C5b-C9 induces cell lysis.
Eicosanoids, Nitric Oxide, Angiotensin, Endothelin:
Contribute to hemodynamic changes.
Cytokines and Chemokines:
IL-1 & TNF cause leukocyte adhesion and glomerular injury.
Coagulation System:

Fibrin leaks out during endothelial injury, contributing to crescent formation.
Mechanisms of Progression in Glomerular Diseases:

Outcome depends on initial severity, nature and persistence of antigens, immune status, age, genetic predisposition.
Main histological characteristics: FSGS( Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis) and Tubulointerstitial Fibrosis (TIF).
Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS):

Sclerosis is an adaptive change in unaffected glomeruli following renal loss.
Compensatory hypertrophy leads to glomerular hypertension and injury.
TGF-β(Transforming Growth Factor-beta) is an implicated mediator.
Targeted therapy: inhibitors of RAS(Renin Angiotensin System) tend to ameliorate progression of sclerosis.
Tubulointerstitial Fibrosis (TIF):

Manifests as tubular damage and interstitial inflammation.
Decline in renal function correlates better with TIF(Tubulointerstitial Fibrosis) than the severity of glomerular injury.
Causes include ischemia, acute and chronic inflammation, loss of peritubular capillary blood supply.
Proteinuria directly injures/activates tubular cells, contributing to interstitial fibrosis.
Filtered proteins may include cytokines, complement products, iron, immunoglobulins, lipid moieties, and oxidatively modified plasma proteins.

Papillary carcinoma (10-15%)
Chromophobe renal carcinoma (5%)
Collecting duct (Bellini duct) carcinoma (≤1%)
Morphology:

Gross: Spherical masses, yellow-gray-white tissue, may invade renal vein.
Microscopic features vary based on RCC type.
Clear cell: Loss of ch3p, VHL mutation, lipid/glycogen-filled cells.
Papillary: Trisomy 16, 17, MET gene anomaly.
Chromophobe: Pale eosinophilic cytoplasm, perinuclear halo.
Clinical Features:

Costovertebral pain, palpable mass, hematuria.
Late stages: Constitutional signs, metastasis to lungs, bones, lymph nodes, liver, adrenal, brain.
Urothelial Carcinoma of Renal Pelvis:

5-10% of renal tumors involve renal pelvis.
Can be benign papillomas or invasive transitional cell carcinoma.
Early presentation due to hematuria, small size at discovery, can cause hydronephrosis.
Histologically, transitional cell neoplasms.
Tips for Exam Preparation:

Understand the importance of early recognition in obstructive uropathy.
Memorize common causes and risk factors for urinary tract obstruction, urolithiasis, and kidney tumors.
Focus on key morphological features of hydronephrosis, stone types, and RCC variants.
Know clinical features associated with different conditions.
Pay attention to risk factors for urolithiasis and RCC.
Understand the classification and characteristics of RCC variants.
Recognize the presentation and risk factors for urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis.
