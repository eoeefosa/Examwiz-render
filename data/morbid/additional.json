    "options": [
      "Stasis in the blood vessel",
      "Hypercoagulability state",
      "Aspirin overdose",
      "Atherosclerosis",

      "Stasis in the blood vessel",
      "Hypercoagulability state",
      "Long term immobility of the lower limb"
    ],
    "explanation": "Thromboembolism can occur from stasis in the blood vessel, hypercoagulability state, and long-term immobility of the lower limb. Aspirin overdose and atherosclerosis are not direct causes of thromboembolism."

    "options": [
      "Ischemic injury to the brain for 1hr",
      "Ischemic injury to the kidney for 30min",
      "Ischemic injury to the liver 40min",

    ],
    "answer": [
      "Ischemic injury to the brain for 1hr",
      "Ischemic injury to the heart 3-5mins"
    ],
    "explanation": "Irreversible damage can occur with ischemic injury. For the brain, irreversible damage may occur after 1 hour of ischemia, and for the heart, it may occur within 3-5 minutes. The other options represent varying degrees of ischemic injury."

    "answer": ["Reperfusion injury", "Vasculitis"],
    "explanation": "Leucocyte-induced injury is implicated in acute inflammation occurring in conditions such as reperfusion injury and vasculitis. Graves disease, atherosclerosis, and chronic transplant rejection involve other mechanisms of inflammation."

    "options": [
      "Neutrophil infiltrate traverses the wall of the appendix",

    "answer": [
      "Neutrophil infiltrate traverses the wall of the appendix",
      "Focal peritonitis can occur"
    ],
    "explanation": "In acute appendicitis, neutrophil infiltrate typically traverses the wall of the appendix, and focal peritonitis can occur. Neutrophil infiltrate in the muscularis propria, lymphocyte aggregate in the muscularis mucosae, and salpingitis are not characteristic findings in acute appendicitis."
