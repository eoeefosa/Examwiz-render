Cardiac Hypertrophy and Dilatation\n\nIn the early phase, the increased workload in the heart is necessary in order to meet the needs of the body. It imposes an additional stress on the myocardium. \nThis results in myocyte hyper-trophy with a decrease in capillary density and increased inter-capillary distance with increase in fibrous tissue. (Referred to as Ventricular remodeling).\nThere is an altered gene expression with production of proteins which are abnormal or dysfunctional thus there is pathologic hyper trophy. \nThere is an increase in size or mass which on HT is seen as concentric hypertrophy. There is induction of the early and intermediate genes resulting in increased proteins synthesis with production of abnormal proteins.\nThere is dilation with increase in the length of the sarcomere and resultant increase in force of contraction and increase on stroke volume (SV). There is also Na retention which results in expansion of the blood volume. This result from activation of renin angiotensin system.\nThe effect of the 10 cardiac disease, the decrease in the blood and O2 supply to the myocytes, the increase in blood volume all impose an additional load on the heart resulting in decompensation. \nWhen decompensation sets in, SV decreases with a resultant decrease in CO resulting in hypoxia and congestive charges in the organs and tissues. There may be associated arrhythmias (manage with antiarrhythmic drugs)."
