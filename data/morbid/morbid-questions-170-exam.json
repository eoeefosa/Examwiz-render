Delayed or lack of develop secondary sexual maturity.\n\n Fetal ovaries develop normally in  embryogenesis but the absence of the second x chromosomes lead to accelerated loss of oocytes  which is complete before 2 to 3 years which means that menopause may occur before menarche  and the ovaries are reduced to streak ovaries (atrophic fibrous strand without oval or follicles)",
