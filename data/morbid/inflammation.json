    "answer": ["The sole member of gamma chemokine is Fractalkine"],
    "explanation": "Chemokines are a family of small proteins that primarily act as chemoattractants, guiding the movement of immune cells. The other options correctly describe various characteristics of chemokines:\n\n(A) Correct: Chemokines are indeed a family of small proteins that primarily act as chemoattractants.\n(B) Correct: Alpha chemokines are classified as CXC chemokines.\n(C) Incorrect: Gamma chemokines typically have multiple members, and Fractalkine is not the sole member of this category. This makes it the odd one out.\n(D) Correct: Eotaxin and RANTES are examples of beta chemokines.\n(E) Correct: Gamma chemokines generally lack the first and third conserved cysteines."
