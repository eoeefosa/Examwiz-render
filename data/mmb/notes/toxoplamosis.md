Acquition of Toxoplamsosis is by

## Acquired

oral
iotogenic
by blood transfusion
babisia
microfilarial
plasmodiam
trypanosoma

however microfilarial do not mature to adult worms when trnsfusion
so morvidity only invovles allergic reaction

## Congenital

via placenta to attack placenta
through infection that the mother acquired

i. after 1st trimester
ii. transmission can also occur at any time during pregnancy
a. prior to pregnancy: those transmitted to women who are immunocompentent it becomes latent. Most of us about 50% have latent toxoplasmosis. No vertical transmision provided
the mother remains immunologically intact. However if there is immunosuppresion the T-gondii can be reactivated.

Summary
Acquire

1. oral route: `infective` oocytes
   injection of tissue cytse
2. congenital
3. blood transfusion

Morphological forms

1. Ooctycte: It is seen in the feaces of cats and other felings. They are oval or spherical in shape. When shared in cat feaces they are unsporulated.sporulation occurs within the environment after 5day and remains alive for up to 12 months. Insecide the oocytes are sporozoites.\

oocytes is resistant to disinfectant, resistant to freezing and drying. but destroyed at temperature of 70 degree celius

Tachizoite detected in blood smear during acute infections
Obligatory intracelular parasite
cresent shaped
trophozote stage seen in acute cases of Toxoplasmosis
0.3 micron
remorted in any population

#### risk population

1. new born

actute infection is confirmed by a rising Teta.

tachizote become bradizotes

Heterozynose life cycle

Definitive host Cat and felning
intermediate host include Goatmeat
Reservoir is rodent

Man is an accidental host of toxoplamosis

IMmune response inhibit

### phases

Aquired
Acute
Latent

### Congenital Toxoplasmosis

Mild
inflamation of coronoid and retina with posible blindness

Severe
hydrocepaly or microcepaly with intracranial calcification, necrosis
Loss of brain parenchyma
unilateral micro othpamiea or bilaterial orthpameia

There is necrosis and distructive calcification.

retina and the brain
include squinting
brain involvement in the immunosuppresed with may lead to large necrotic areas in the brain
disease may result in the rupture of tissue cyste

T.gondii does not produce toxins

Clinical manifestation
four major groups

### ACQUIRED IN IMMUNOCOMPETENT

asymptomatic 10-20%
those with fluid like symptoms

### IMMUNOCOROPMINED

Ocular Toxoplasmosis
Congenital Toxoplasmosis
CNS DISEAse
myocardiatit

Hiv pateint presenting with encaphalites. Most common cause of intracerebral lession. usally due to reactivation of a chronic infections

##### OCULAR TOXOPLASMOSIS

may be congenitail or acquired
congenitally acquired may be up to the 2nd and 3rd decayed of life.
due to cyst rupture

chroid retinitis is often bilaterial compaired to those with acute aquired

if the infection is in the first trimester there is more likelyhood of servere congenital toxoplasmosis
When clinical apperent it may mimick other disease of new born

involvement of the CNS Is the hallmark of congenital toxoplasmosis

### CLASSICAL TRIAD OF TOXOPLASMOSIS

chorin retinitis
intracranial calification
hydrocepalus

FEVER
jaundice
convulsion
or choriortinitis usaully bilateral
and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid are classic future of severe toxoplasmosis
Some infected children without oval disease may escape serious sequelling of infection. However a significant number may manifest with
a. choro retinitis
b. developmental delay
c. epilesy
d. defeaness
years later

Areas of pronoused folicular hyperplasia
toxoplasma lymphadinites must be differentated from Tb lymphadenitis

Giant langerhan cells
and area of caesation in Tb lymphadenitis

pugulian

### Diagnosis

histology
cerology

histology would show

Acutiely dividing Tarchizoid
Secific antibody produced by T-gondii

isolation of organism during acute infection

Cerologcal diagnosis
SAbin felman dye test: principle staining life tarchizote in blood with methyline blue

immunoflorecent
enzyme linked immonassay

## treatment

combination of antiparasitic and antibacteria

## ATEROMYCETES
