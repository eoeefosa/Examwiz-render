      "The predominant inflammatory cells in the skin lesions in tuberculous leprosy are lymphocytes while in lepromatous leprosy they are macrophages."
    ],
    "explanation": "Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. Tuberculoid leprosy is curable with rifampicin and Dapsone therapy within 3 months. Leprosy bacilli tend to infect cooler parts of the body. Leprosy patients can be cared for in leprosy hospitals (leprosariums) but are not necessarily 'better taken care of' there. The predominant inflammatory cells in tuberculous leprosy are lymphocytes, while in lepromatous leprosy, they are macrophages."

      "None of the above"

    "answer": ["None of the above"],
    "explanation": "Rabies is not characterized by finding intranuclear inclusion bodies, and the diagnosis is not based on this finding. The incubation period of rabies is typically longer, ranging from days to years. There are no effective antiviral drugs for rabies, and treatment involves post-exposure prophylaxis with rabies vaccine."

    "answer": [
      "Invasive disease may complicate viral pneumonias like COVID-19 and influenza"
    ],
    "explanation": "Aspergillosis can cause invasive disease in immunocompromised individuals, but it can also cause allergic disease, such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), characterized by type III hypersensitivity reactions. It is not exclusively an endemic mycosis and can occur in various environments. Peptidoglycan is not a component of Aspergillus and is not used for diagnosis."

A chest x-ray reveals the presence of a fungal ball in a cavity, and a diagnosis of aspergilloma is made. Which of the following is correct?",
    "options": [
      "Sputum microscopy may show fungi with broad aseptate hyphae",
      "The patient should repeat anti-Koch's therapy despite negative Ziehl-Neelsen smear and Gene Xpert test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis",

      "Surgical resection is not an option and is strongly contraindicated.",
      "The patient will likely have elevated Aspergillus IgG antibodies"
    ],
    "answer": [
      "The patient will likely have elevated Aspergillus IgG antibodies"
    ],
    "explanation": "In a case of aspergilloma following tuberculosis, sputum microscopy may show fungi with broad aseptate hyphae characteristic of Aspergillus species. Repeat anti-tubercular therapy is not indicated if the patient has completed a full course and shows no evidence of active tuberculosis. Long-term antifungal therapy or surgical resection may be considered based on the clinical scenario."

    "options": [
      "Uncomplicated disease presents as viral pneumonia",
      "Is effectively treated with protease inhibitors",
      "Haemagglutinin inhibitor is the drug of choice",

    ],
    "answer": [
      "Symptomatic relief of fever with aspirin is contraindicated in children"
    ],
    "explanation": "Uncomplicated influenza typically presents with symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, and fatigue. While antiviral drugs like neuraminidase inhibitors (e.g., oseltamivir) are used for treatment, they are not protease inhibitors. Haemagglutinin inhibitors are not the primary treatment for influenza. Aspirin is contraindicated in children due to the risk of Reye's syndrome."

      "Antigenic shift is facilitated by the segmented nature of the virus",
      "Annual vaccination addresses the issue of antigenic shift",
      "Pandemics arise from the virus undergoing antigenic drift",
      "None of the above"
    ],
    "answer": ["Annual vaccination addresses the issue of antigenic shift"],
    "explanation": "Antigenic shift in influenza A virus is caused by reassortment of gene segments between different influenza viruses, not point mutations. The segmented nature of the virus allows for this reassortment. Annual vaccination aims to address antigenic drift, not shift, by updating the vaccine strains to match circulating strains. Pandemics can arise from antigenic shift, not drift."

      "Only 3 serotypes cause disease in man",
      "An oral live vaccine and injectable killed vaccine are routinely used to prevent disease",
      "Meningitis is a common manifestation"
    ],
    "answer": ["Fecal-oral route of transmission is common"],
    "explanation": "Adenoviruses can infect various organs, not specifically the liver. They are commonly transmitted through respiratory droplets, not the fecal-oral route. There are many serotypes of adenoviruses that can cause disease in humans, not just three. Vaccines for adenoviruses are available, but they are not routinely used and vary in formulation based on the serotype."
